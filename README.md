# RickRollScript
Creates a Scheduled Task to rickroll the current user on next sign in.

The Rick script will attempt to find what internet browsers are currently installed on the computer and use that browser to launch the youtube window.

On the next login of the current user a youtube window will display a short clip from Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up".

The focus script also launches which will wait 3 seconds, then focus on that browser window, and then enter the F11 key, then the 'f' key. This put the window in full screen.
